Some lifted from Slaughter and Rex

Globals
-------

arch - Either i386 or amd64, depending upon the type of the system.
bits - 32 or 64 depending on the client system.
domain - The domain portion of the hostname.
fqdn - The fully qualified (long) hostname of the client system.
hostname - The short (unqualified) hostname of the client system.
kernel - The version of the kernel running upon the client system.

Make more quiet -> verbose as an option

Run a command once on nextboot (perhaps using @restart in cron)

* simpler constructors: cmd(), file(), service(), install()

Log the output of commands as they happen

Be able to upgrade perl
Be able to upgrade base packages

Put minion / api code in it's own branch - focus on ssh

Need a tmpdir for little files 'n things for the currently executing script

CTRL-C doesn't seem to work well

patched.pl generate bundle

Deploy to a host with a single file (perhaps par packed)

Log prior state and ending state

Possibly a host() sub for Patched::Minimal

    host("local.box", sub {
        my $self = shift;

        ssh($ARGV[0])->run("-");

        exit;
    });

    The goal is to be able to simply run an adhoc script onto one or more boxen

Add support for __DATA__ templates and config files

Should Patched::User::upsert die if existing user doesn't match passed in criteria?
